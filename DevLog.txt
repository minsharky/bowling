# 376-FinalGame
Development Log

11/18
Met as a team to discuss final project ideas. Ideal objective is 3D; want to see how the flight simulator goes before committing.
Ideas:
- 2D Mario-like game
- 3D Bowling
- 3D FPS (First Person Shooter)
How to meet implementation requirements: powerup mechanic

11/29
Met at Starbucks. Akash was two hours late.
Discussion to finalize project idea:
- Consensus on doing a 3D game for the 25 point criterium
Potential bowling game:
- Basic objects: Bowling ball, alley, pin(s), scoreboard (screen text), gutters
- Extras: powerup item, bumpers
  - Powerup items: speed, mass increase, move the ball closer to the pins, pin size up, bumper activate, score multiplier
- player controlls the bowling ball; it rolls along the alley to hit the pins
- if the ball collides with a powerup object, it gets a respective boost
- if the ball enters/collides with the gutter, lose condition
- if the ball hits a pin, score increase
- simplified rules; initially we will not attempt to implement all rules of real-life bowling
Minseo was also late, and David overslept. 
Made the Devlog into a burn book, Mean Girls Style.
