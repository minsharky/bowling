# 376-FinalGame
Development Log

11/18
Met as a team to discuss final project ideas. Ideal objective is 3D; want to see how the flight simulator goes before committing.
Ideas:
- 2D Mario-like game
- 3D Bowling
- 3D FPS (First Person Shooter)
How to meet implementation requirements: powerup mechanic

11/29
Met at Starbucks. Akash was two hours late.
Discussion to finalize project idea:
- Consensus on doing a 3D game for the 25 point criterium
Potential bowling game:
- Basic objects: Bowling ball, alley, pin(s), scoreboard (screen text), gutters
- Extras: powerup item, bumpers
  - Powerup items: speed, mass increase, move the ball closer to the pins, pin size up, bumper activate, score multiplier
- player controlls the bowling ball; it rolls along the alley to hit the pins
- if the ball collides with a powerup object, it gets a respective boost
- if the ball enters/collides with the gutter, lose condition
- if the ball hits a pin, score increase
- simplified rules; initially we will not attempt to implement all rules of real-life bowling
Minseo was also late, and David overslept. 
Made the Devlog into a burn book, Mean Girls Style.

Minseo had object ideas. Hazards! Hitting it slows you down, or curves the ball in a certain way. 

11/29: 11:32 AM
We have three aesthetic goals.
1. Challenge. The game should be challenging to some degree. The user should feel happy when they win, or make a lot of progress in the game. If the game is too hard, or too easy, then it does not meet the challenge aesthetic goal.
2. Submission. The game should be an entertaining pasttime. For example, the user should be excited to see what the powerups do, and try them all out. The user should enjoy the game, but not find it incredibly challenging or boring. We do not meet this aesthetic goal if the user finds it too difficult to play. 
3. Sensation. The game should sound realistic, and fun. We don't meet this aesthetic objective if the sounds are annoying. 

11/29: 11:39 AM
Core Loop:
Position the ball (change its angle/position relative to the pins)
Bowl the ball
(Optional) Hit and activate powerups/powerdowns
(Optional) Hit pins, and change score
Repeat

This should be sufficient to generate a challenge and a fun pasttime for the user. 

11/29: 11:44 AM
Order of operations:
Basic layout for the game already (Akash put that together)
Controlling the ball (Rachel is doing that)
Pin prefab, and adding it to the game (Minseo is doing that)
Scoring mechanisms
Lose conditions
Timer that caps how long the user can play
Powerups
Powerdowns
Implemented "r" reset button.

11/29: 1:00 PM
Minseo created the "pins" prefab.

11/2: 2:27 PM

Amenments to lose and win conditions: 

Win condition: If you exceed a certain score in a certain number of rounds, you win.
Lose condition: If you fail to exceed the score in the number of rounds, you lose.
